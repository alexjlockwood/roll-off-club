# Easy 4 + Easy 4

![Easy 4 + Easy 4](../images/variations/easy-4-easy-4.jpg)

## Overview

[Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#orange) + [Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#blue), also known as "4 by 4", is the easiest roll off variation.

## Paths

To timeout this variation, simply jump 4 times on orange, transfer to blue, and jump 4 times on blue. This path can be done all 12 laps.

Beginning with the 9th lap, it can be useful to start with 3 jumps on orange instead. By transfering to blue earlier, you give more space for others to follow behind.
