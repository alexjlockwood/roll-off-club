# Avoiding Griefers

!!! warning

    This page is still a work in progress. 🙃

## Learn the roll patterns

Learning the roll patterns will make it much easier for you to change up your pathing on-the-fly in order to avoid a griefer.

## Don't draw attention to yourself early on

Stay out of the way early on and don't draw attention to yourself. Just focus on the roll patterns and your own pathing. Most griefers spend so much time trying to kill other players early on that they neglect to memorize the roll patterns, so by the time the slime rises and the rolls get faster, they panic and die.

## Kill the griefer

You can push the griefer into a gap:

You can pants a griefer before they jump a gap:

</video>

It is easier to kill griefers when you surprise them, so try not to draw attention to yourself early on and they won't suspect it.

## One-rolling

You can one-roll to avoid a griefer:

</video>

!!! warning

    Avoid one-rolling early on in the timeout, as it will draw attention to yourself and
    make it more likely that griefers will focus on killing you.

## Other TODOs

Still need clips/examples of these strategies:

* Jump early to cancel grabs
* Switching to the opposite roll
    * Example: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijl9Lo8jsDw> (need better example?)
* Drawing them out to the edge
* Avoid jumping when griefers nearby
* Bunny hop on roll off to avoid griefers similar to jump showdown
* Stay out of the way and don't draw attention to yourself at the start when dealing with griefers
