# Wall Jumps & One-Rolling

## Wall jumps

Wall jumping refers to the act of jumping around the side of a wall in Roll Off. It is an advanced strategy used to avoid griefers and desync, especially late in a timeout. It is also is used to complete [one-roll challenges](./wall-jumps-one-rolling.md#one-roll-timeouts).

When performing wall jumps, I recommend doing them without dives when possible. Although it feels more dangerous, with practice you will be able to get consistent. It also avoids two common bugs that can occur when performing wall jumps with dives:

### Dive bug

The dive bug refers to an annoying bug where your bean seemingly dives at the wrong angle when performing a wall jump. This bug occurs when you don't have enough horizontal momentum towards the roll when you press the dive input. It fairly difficult to avoid and can still occur randomly when performing wall jumps with dives.

### Elimination bug

The elimination bug refers to a bug where your bean will be eliminated while your bean is still running on the platform. This bug can occur even when wall jumping without dives, but is more likely to occur when either (1) you are wall jump-diving to a small ledge, or (2) you are playing on high ping.

## One-roll timeouts

One-rolling is the act of staying on the same roll for all 12 laps of a timeout, done by jumping around the right side of the walls of the roll. It is possible to one-roll all rolls except [Grand Canyon Blue](../rolls/grand-canyon.md).

Below are example one roll timeouts to use as reference:
