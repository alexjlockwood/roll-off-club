# 提前识别版型

!!! 注意

    从2023年5月更新的SS4赛季开始，滚轮行动的准备界面动画有较大变化，导致可以用来识别版型的信息变少。

在准备界面的动画播放时，玩家可以尝试快速识别出滚轮版型，这样在第1圈就不用花时间识别了。

## 通过彩边和侧面条纹颜色识别

橙轮的彩边有紫色和金色。如果是紫色，则可能是；如果是金色，则可能是
蓝轮的彩边有橙色、紫色和金色。如果是橙色，则可能是；如果是紫色，则必然是；如果是金色，则必然是
特别地，蓝天坑是唯一一个侧面条纹颜色与彩边颜色不对应的版型。蓝天坑的侧面条纹为橙色（其他蓝轮均为蓝色），前后条纹为绿色（其他轮均和彩边为统一颜色）。

## 通过开头和结尾的障碍识别

以下是一个可以用来识别版型的决策树。由于准备界面动画的改变，这种方法已不太实用。即便不能在准备界面识别出版型也不必惊慌，

## Other tips

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md) Blue can be recognized early by its purple edge color, as it is the only blue roller with purple edges.

![Isolated Duo Blue](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/isolated-duo-blue-side-view.jpg)

Similarly, [Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md) Blue can be recognized early by its gold edge color, as it is the only blue roller with gold edges.
